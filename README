= JsI18n

This is a rails plugin for i18n messages in javascript code.
It not depends from any javascript frameworks, so you can use it with prototype.js, jQuery or any other without modification.

== Installation & Usage

After plugin installing you need to call generator with required locales as arguments:

script/generate js_locales en ru

This command copy i18n.js file into public/javascripts directory and create two locale files under public/javascripts/locales directory.

After this add following line into your view to make i18n functionality available for your scripts:

<%= javascript_i18n_include %>

This helper include i18n.js file and required js locale file, depending on I18n.locale rails environment.

Locale js files contains just a hash object with name Translations and one required field "locale", when "locale" is not defined "en" will be used as default value.

So here is basic content for such file (public/javascripts/locales/ru.js):
var Translations = {
  locale: 'ru'
};

Message can be a pair with string key:
var Translations = {
  locale: 'ru',
  "foo.bar": "baz"
};

or a nested hash:
var Translations = {
  locale: 'ru',
  foo: {
    bar: "baz"
  }
};

You can use it from javascript in the same way as from ruby code, i.e.:
var fooMessage = I18n.t("foo.bar");

To get current locale you can call I18n.locale() method.
